Now you have: game records (sgf files)
You want: game analysis of every situation (total number of move in a game = 68 --> 68 situations for that game) in every game from KataGo 18blocks 9x9 in a .jsonl file: 

Pipeline: 

0. Move the KataGo18b9x9.gz package and the katago.exe file to the same folder (I would recommend to put everything under this folder)

1. (sgf_to_jsonl.py) extract info from sgf file to a .jsonl file (json_output.jsonl), remember to change paths within the python script. 

2. (analysis.cfg) put this configuration file in the same folder where everything is located

3. copy and paste those line by line to your terminal (ignore comments), wait for a long time, then you will get a .jsonl file (json_output_with_top_k.jsonl), that's what we want: 

##### Configuration paths (please change them to your own paths)
$KataGoExe   = "D:\katago_old\lizzie\katago.exe"

$ModelFile   = "D:\katago_old\lizzie\KataGo18b9x9.gz"

$ConfigFile  = "D:\katago_old\lizzie\analysis.cfg"

$InputJsonl  = "D:\katago_old\lizzie\json_output.jsonl"

$OutputJsonl = "D:\katago_old\lizzie\json_output_with_top_k.jsonl"

##### Check if those files exist (false -->you have  inputed wrong paths)
"exe:       " + (Test-Path $KataGoExe)

"model:     " + (Test-Path $ModelFile)

"config:    " + (Test-Path $ConfigFile)

"inputjson: " + (Test-Path $InputJsonl)

###### Run it (make sure to keep those tabs)
Get-Content $InputJsonl -Raw |

  & $KataGoExe analysis `

      -config $ConfigFile `

      -model  $ModelFile `

      -analysis-threads 1 |

  Set-Content $OutputJsonl

Noted: 

Ahead of that, I have: 

(1) used total_move_histogram.py to plot "total number of moves of all games records vs frequency"

(2) used pick_random_sgf_based_on_total_move.py to have a glance of the quality (if this game is worth studying for the model) of a random game that has a particular total number of move

Eventually, I decided to preserve games of total number of moves âˆˆ [20, 70]
